## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I used root variables to simplify my css code. Instead of creating div blocks and then styling the div blocks I used a li and a and styled those items instead making it a cleaner code. 

```:root {
    --Green: hsl(75, 94%, 57%);
    --White: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    --Grey: hsl(0, 0%, 20%);
    --Dark-Grey: hsl(0, 0%, 12%);
    --Off-Black: hsl(0, 0%, 8%);
}
```

I also wasnt flagged for incorrect structure on my code so that's another win.

### Continued development

I want to keep pushing on responsive design until it becomes second nature. It such an important aspect of web design and it can increase the amount of time spent developing when you have to figure out what are the tools for responsive design. I usually always still just the body in css but using more semantics helps to improve my code and I tried to do that here.
